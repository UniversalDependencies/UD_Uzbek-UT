# Summary

This is the first Uzbek UD treebank. 


# Introduction

Uzbek-UT consists of 500 sentences, 250 of which were sourced from news articles and 250 from fiction. These two genres can be told apart with sentence IDs, meaning that the first half of the treebank belongs to news articles and the second half to fiction. Tokenization and lemmatization were carried out automatically. POS tags and dependency relations were annotated semi-automatically with full manual corrections.

    abstract = "We present the first Universal Dependencies treebank for Uzbek, a low-resource language from the Turkic family. The treebank contains 500 sentences (5850 tokens) sourced from the news and fiction genres and it is annotated for lemmas, part-of-speech (POS) tags, morphological features, and dependency relations. We describe our methodology for building the treebank, which consists of a mix of manual and automatic annotation and discuss some constructions of the Uzbek language that pose challenges to the UD framework."
